* This code is for a weather dashboard. When the user puts in a city of choice and hits the search button the webpage will populate with information about the cities current weather. It will also display a forecast of that cities weather 5 days out from the current date. 

* The user is prompted to enter in a city. It can be any city. With this information a call is made with an API the Open Weather website to select the city information and populate the webpage with current data.

* Using an API key creates many opportunity for dynamic webpages. API keys allow for the user to quicky get informaiton about many different things. The API in my code is allowing for the user to get any city weather in a matter of seconds. It can solve the problem of your webpages not being dynamic or easily adabpable to changing data.

* I struggled with trying to get the data the user enters into and out of local storage. In addition the weather icon for the 5-day forecast seems to be not clearing each time though the function so it prints many different icons after a few city searches.
